# Codrops Freebie

A training project based on [a design that doesn't suck](https://dribbble.com/shots/1794875-Freebie-PSD-Halcyon-Days-Website-PSD).

Built on the [Hamlman](http://github.com/meowsus/hamlman) [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) Project Template.

Basic exploration into [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com)' [ITCSS](http://itcss.io/) framework, which is still a WIP.

And just for good measure, here's another [link](http://linkslinkslinkslinkslinks.net)!
